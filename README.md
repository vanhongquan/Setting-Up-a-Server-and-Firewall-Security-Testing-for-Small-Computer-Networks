# Setting-Up-a-Server-and-Firewall-Security-Testing-for-Small-Computer-Networks

Secure server setup with firewall for small networks. Conducting security testing &amp; documenting procedures on GitHub.

Project Description: Setting up a server and firewall, conducting security testing for a small computer network.

Objectives:

Establish and configure a server to provide services for the internal network.
Deploy and configure a firewall to protect the network and servers from external threats.
Perform security testing to assess the safety and security of the system.

Step 1: Server Setup:

Choose a suitable operating system and install it on the server.
Configure basic services such as web server, database server, and file server.
Identify and configure security mechanisms such as authentication, access control, and monitoring.

Step 2: Firewall Deployment:

Select and deploy a firewall solution suitable for the network's needs.
Configure firewall rules to control data flow between the internal network and the Internet.
Establish security rules to prevent common types of attacks such as DDoS, brute force, and SQL injection attacks.

Step 3: Security Testing:

Use security testing tools such as Nessus, Nmap, and Metasploit to scan and detect security vulnerabilities on servers and networks.
Perform simulated attack scenarios such as brute force, DoS, and phishing attacks to assess the system's ability to withstand these attacks.
Analyze and evaluate the test results, then implement new security measures or updates to address vulnerabilities and improve system security.

Expected Results:

A small computer network environment established and protected by an effective firewall system.
Security vulnerabilities detected and addressed, ensuring the safety and security of the system.
Real-world experience and valuable knowledge about network security deployment and management gathered.
